# Boston Housing ML Project

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It leverages linear regression to understand the relationship between features like the number of rooms, age, and distance to employment centers, among others, and the median value of homes (`medv`).

## Files
- `boston_housing_ml.py`: Main Python script with the code for loading the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- `BostonHousing.csv`: Dataset file (ensure to add this to the project directory).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
